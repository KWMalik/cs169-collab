'The Magic Words are Squeamish Ossifrage' was the solution to an RSA challenge ciphertext posed in 1977 and subsequently solved in 1994 by a joint computer project that coordinated many machines via the Internet. The phrase is significant to this assignment because we are using RSA keys to connect to the EC2 instances, and cloud computing environments such as Amazon's EC2 now make it much simpler to harness the amount of computing power necessary to break such ciphers.
