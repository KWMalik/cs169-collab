The optimal number of application processes is 8. In our HTTPerf benchmarks, we noticed a fairly steep linear increase in the number of requests per second when we doubled the number of application processes from 1 to 2, 2 to 4, and then 4 to 8.  However, the returns diminished greatly (to logarithmic growth) when we tried using 16 and 32 application processes, indicating that using more than 8 processes is probably not worth it.  Doubling the number of processes does not necessarily mean doubling our metric of performance because the database becomes a bottleneck as it tries to serve all the different processes.
